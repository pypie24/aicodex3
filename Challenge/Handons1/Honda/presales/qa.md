When assessing Honda's need to ingest data from Aras, which uses both SQL Server and unstructured data, here are key questions and concerns to address:

### Questions for Assessment:
1. **Data Sources & Types**:
   - What is the structure and volume of the data in SQL Server? (how many tables, erd, logs_tables)
   - What kind of unstructured data are you handling (e.g., documents, images, logs)? Need to extract data from files.
   - How frequently does the data from Aras need to be ingested (real-time, batch, or periodic)?
   
2. **Current Infrastructure**:
   - Is there any datalake, hub or warehouse? Technology
   - What is your current data storage and processing infrastructure?
   - Are you using any specific tools for ETL (Extract, Transform, Load)?
   - How is the data currently integrated or consumed by downstream systems?
   
3. **Integration Points**:
   - Do you have APIs or other mechanisms in place for data extraction from SQL Server and unstructured sources?
   - Is there a need for data enrichment or transformation during ingestion?

4. **Performance & Scalability**:
   - What are the performance expectations for data ingestion?
   - How much data growth do you anticipate over the next few years?
   - Are there any specific SLAs (Service Level Agreements) for uptime and data latency?

5. **Security & Compliance**:
   - What data privacy or compliance standards need to be adhered to (e.g., GDPR, HIPAA)?
   - How are you currently securing your data during transit and at rest?
   - Do you require encryption for both structured and unstructured data?

6. **Data Management**:
   - Do you have a data governance framework in place for managing and cataloging both structured and unstructured data?
   - How do you handle data quality and ensure consistency?

7. **Tools & Technology**:
   - What tools do you currently use for data ingestion, if any?
   - Are there any preferences or restrictions on cloud or on-premises solutions?

8. **Downstream Usage**:
   - How will the ingested data be consumed (e.g., analytics, reporting, machine learning)?
   - What are the downstream systems that will be using this data, and what are their requirements?

### Concerns to Address:
1. **Data Volume & Complexity**:
   - Ingesting large volumes of both structured and unstructured data requires robust infrastructure. Ensure that the solution can scale to meet current and future needs.

2. **Data Transformation**:
   - Structured data from SQL Server may need to be transformed to fit the requirements of the target system. Unstructured data might need additional processing (e.g., OCR for text extraction).

3. **Latency and Throughput**:
   - Ensuring low-latency and high-throughput ingestion pipelines, especially if real-time analytics or decision-making is required.

4. **Compatibility**:
   - Assess whether the target system (Alibaba Cloud, AWS, etc.) supports the specific tools or integrations needed for seamless data ingestion from SQL Server and unstructured data.

5. **Data Storage**:
   - Depending on the volume and type of data, determine whether you need separate storage mechanisms (e.g., SQL databases for structured data, object storage for unstructured data).

6. **Compliance and Security**:
   - Ensure compliance with industry regulations and company policies around data handling, especially for sensitive or proprietary information.

Addressing these questions and concerns will help in designing a robust solution for Hondaâ€™s data ingestion from Aras.
