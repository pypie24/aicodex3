## Components

1. **User Devices**
   - **Web and Mobile Clients**: Built using React.js and React Native, these clients connect to the backend services.

2. **Load Balancer**
   - **AWS Elastic Load Balancer (ELB)**: Distributes incoming traffic across multiple web servers (EC2 instances) to ensure high availability and reliability.

3. **Web Servers**
   - **EC2 Instances**: Host the frontend and backend applications. Auto-scaling groups will be configured to handle varying loads.

4. **API Gateway**
   - **AWS API Gateway**: Manages and secures API endpoints, providing a single entry point for all client requests.

5. **Application Server**
   - **Node.js with Express.js**: Handles business logic and processes client requests.

6. **Real-Time Server**
   - **WebSocket Server**: Manages real-time communication between clients and the server using WebSocket protocol for low-latency data transfer.

7. **Database**
   - **MongoDB Atlas**: A managed NoSQL database service that provides high availability, scalability, and security.

8. **Authentication**
   - **AWS Cognito**: Manages user authentication and authorization, supporting social media logins and JWT-based session management.

9. **Content Delivery Network (CDN)**
   - **AWS CloudFront**: Distributes static content (images, videos, etc.) globally to reduce latency and improve load times.

10. **Monitoring**
    - **New Relic/Datadog**: Monitors application performance, logs, and metrics to ensure the system is running smoothly and to detect any issues promptly.

11. **Message Queue**
    - **AWS SQS**: Manages message queues to handle asynchronous tasks and ensure reliable message delivery.

12. **Cache**
    - **Redis**: Provides in-memory caching to reduce database load and improve response times for frequently accessed data.

## Real-Time Participation Flow

1. **User Joins Quiz**
   - User connects to the WebSocket server via the client application.
   - WebSocket server authenticates the user using JWT tokens provided by AWS Cognito.

2. **Real-Time Communication**
   - WebSocket server maintains a persistent connection with the client for real-time data transfer.
   - Quiz questions, answers, and scores are sent and received in real-time through WebSocket messages.

3. **Data Synchronization**
   - Real-time server updates the database (MongoDB Atlas) with quiz participation data.
   - Redis cache is used to store frequently accessed data to reduce database load.

4. **Scalability and Load Management**
   - AWS ELB distributes incoming WebSocket connections across multiple EC2 instances.
   - Auto-scaling groups ensure that additional instances are launched to handle increased load during peak times.

5. **Monitoring and Alerts**
   - New Relic/Datadog monitors the performance of the WebSocket server and other components.
   - Alerts are configured to notify administrators of any performance issues or failures.

## Security

1. **Data Encryption**
   - Encrypt data in transit using HTTPS and WSS (WebSocket Secure).
   - Encrypt data at rest using AWS KMS.

2. **Compliance**
   - Ensure the system complies with GDPR and other relevant data protection regulations.

3. **Access Control**
   - Implement role-based access control (RBAC) to restrict access to sensitive data and functionalities.

## CI/CD Pipeline

1. **Source Control**
   - Use GitHub for version control.

2. **Continuous Integration**
   - Use GitHub Actions for automated testing and building.

3. **Continuous Deployment**
   - Use AWS CodePipeline for automated deployment to staging and production environments.

## Backup and Recovery

1. **Database Backups**
   - Configure automated backups for MongoDB Atlas.

2. **Disaster Recovery**
   - Implement a disaster recovery plan to ensure business continuity in case of failures.

## Cost Management

1. **Cost Monitoring**
   - Use AWS Cost Explorer to monitor and manage cloud spending.

2. **Resource Optimization**
   - Implement auto-scaling and right-sizing of resources to optimize costs.

This infrastructure setup ensures that the Kahoot clone app can handle real-time hosting efficiently, providing a seamless and engaging experience for users.
